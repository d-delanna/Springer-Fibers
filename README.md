# Springer-Fibers

This code automates the process of producing Springer Cells from a given Balanced Yamanouchi Word of 3 distinct letters. 
(Balanced Yamanouchi Words of 3 characters that occur n times each are referred to as (3,n)-words.)
A list of all (3,2)-words and (3,3) words and an example are availble. 

Future Work: Code that automates the process of non-Springer Cells from a given Balanced Non-Yamanouchi Word is in progress.
